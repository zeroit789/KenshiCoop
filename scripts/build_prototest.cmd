@echo off
REM Build dist\prototest.exe - the asserting unit layer for the wire protocol,
REM content hash and interpolation buffer (src\prototest). Uses the same v100
REM (VC++ 2010) x64 compiler as the plugin so the packed-struct layout under
REM test is EXACTLY the layout the shipped DLL compiles (that is the point:
REM prototest locks the wire contract of this toolchain).
REM
REM No game/KenshiLib/ENet dependencies - just the CRT (+ Win32 for Config.cpp's
REM last-peer file, which resolves next to the module = cwd in this test exe).

echo === Building prototest.exe (Release^|x64, v100) ===
REM KENSHICOOP_PROTOTEST keeps SaveXfer.cpp CRT-only (its NetLink/engine-coupled
REM sender + quiescence watch are #ifdef'd out) so the real save-transfer RECEIVER
REM (onSaveBegin/onSaveFile/onSaveDone -> stage/verify/commit) can be exercised
REM end-to-end here without pulling in ENet/KenshiLib. savexfer_test.cpp adds the
REM data-safety unit coverage on top of that same receiver, and Config.cpp backs
REM main.cpp's last-peer persistence round-trip - both stay in the build.
