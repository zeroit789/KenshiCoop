.SYNOPSIS
  Restore pristine fixture save(s) from the repo (fixtures\saves\<name>) into the
  live Kenshi save folder (%LOCALAPPDATA%\kenshi\save\<name>) before a test run.

.DESCRIPTION
  Both the host and Kenshi-Join installs load saves from the SAME per-user folder.
  During a co-op session the host connect-push bakes the live world over the loaded
  save and the join stream-commits into it, so a validation fixture drifts across
  runs. This script mirrors the repo's pristine copy over the AppData copy so every
  run starts from a known-good state; the game only ever mutates the AppData copy,
  which this discards on the next restore.

  Uses robocopy /MIR, so the destination becomes an EXACT copy of the repo fixture
  (stale drift files are removed). Debug saves that have no repo fixture are skipped.

.EXAMPLE
  # Restore one save (what run_test.ps1 calls automatically):
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\deploy_saves.ps1 -Save sync

.EXAMPLE
  # Restore every tracked fixture (e.g. once before a full regression):
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\deploy_saves.ps1 -All
