    # KenshiCoop scenario manifest - the single declarative source of truth for
    # WHICH oracles judge each scenario, which save/setup it needs, and which
    # regression tier it belongs to. Consumed by CoopOracles.psm1 (oracle
    # dispatch + verdict rule), run_test.ps1 (save/setup defaults, gating),
    # regress.ps1 (tier matrices) and analyze_run.ps1 (offline verdicts).
    #
    # Per-scenario fields:
    #   Save        - save both clients load (must exist in %LOCALAPPDATA%\kenshi\save)
    #   Setup       - host-only KENSHICOOP_SETUP scene ('' = none)
    #   Tolerance   - default cross-check tolerance (world units)
    #   PrimaryGate - the mechanism proof. FAIL **or SKIP** of this gate fails
    #                 the run (the no-signal guard): a green run must prove its
    #                 core mechanism was actually judged.
    #   Gating      - oracle ids that gate the verdict (FAIL fails the run; SKIP
    #                 is tolerated unless the oracle is the PrimaryGate)
    #   Advisory    - oracle ids that are measured + recorded but never gate
    #   Tier        - 'smoke' (per-pipeline sample) | 'full' | 'none' (diagnostic)
    #   WanVariant  - $true: the full tier reruns this scenario under the WAN
    #                 proxy (profile 'bad') as a second, separately-reported run
    #
    # Smoke-tier selection principle: ONE scenario per wire pipeline, preferring
    # the bidirectional superset (it strictly covers the unidirectional case):
    #   coop_presence     - unreliable entity stream + ownership partition
    #   npc_sync          - interest-managed world NPCs + intent/task/pose
    #   combat_kill       - reliable event channel + attribution + outcome
    #   inv_bidir         - inventory snapshot/reconcile (both directions)

    #   world_armor_drop  - same channel, EQUIPPED armor piece (real-session repro)
