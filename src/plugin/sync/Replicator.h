//     thread (called BEFORE the engine tick so the snapshot is current).
//   * ingest(): drain received entity transforms into per-entity interpolation
//     buffers (called BEFORE the engine tick so apply targets are current).
//   * applyTargets(): sample each buffer at the render time and apply the
//     interpolated pose to the resolved local Character (called AFTER the engine
//     tick so our write is the last word the renderer samples, beating the local
//     AI that re-decides each frame).

// Stage 2 routes apply through the interpolation buffer (smooth gliding); the
// transform is still committed via a raw teleport (no walk animation yet - that
// is Stage 3).
