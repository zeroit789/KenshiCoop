// SaveXfer - coordinated save + session resume (protocol 31).
//
// The HOST's save is authoritative: on a coordinated save the host writes its
// native save (which already contains the join's squad state via the sync
// channels), waits for the folder to QUIESCE (Kenshi's save is deferred +
// multi-file: quick.save + platoon/*.platoon + zone/*.zone + portraits), then
// streams the whole save folder to the join over CH_RELIABLE in ~4 KB chunks.
// The join stages into save/<name>__incoming/, verifies per-file hashes on
// DONE, commits (replace save/<name>/), and ACKs. Resume = both clients load
// the identical file, which re-runs the shared-save-lineage guarantee all the
// hand-keyed replication rests on (no sidecar; session-placed buildings and
// recruits bake into ONE save with ONE hand, identical on both sides).
//
// This header is engine-free (file IO + wire only); Plugin.cpp drives it from
// the main thread. VS2010 (v100) compatible.
