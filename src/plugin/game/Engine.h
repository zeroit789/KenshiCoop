// Every call here either reads or pokes live game memory, so it is the ONLY
// place allowed to touch the engine, and only ever from the main (game) thread.

//
// Stage 0 surface is intentionally tiny: detect "gameplay is live" and drive the
// save auto-load. Later stages extend this module with entity resolve/apply.

// SURVIVES re-containering (the protocol-23 re-key evidence), so a per-poll
// pointer -> hand map diff catches EVERY move flavor (UI drag, createSquad,
// separate-into-own-squad) with one mechanism. A pointer that LEFT the roster
// reports a zeroed after-hand (dismissal/death - the stored hand is reported
// without dereferencing the possibly-freed pointer). Brand-NEW pointers are
// NOT edges here: recruit ENTRY is the protocol-23 detour's story.
