// Protocol version. Bumped to 2 when EntityState gained the bodyState field
// (Stage 2 down/dead/ragdoll replication); to 3 when the reliable event channel
// (PKT_EVENT: KO/death/revive transitions) was added; to 4 when the combat intent
// (TASK_COMBAT_MELEE) began riding the existing task+subject fields (Stage 3c); to
// 5 when the inventory/container-contents snapshot (PKT_INV_SNAPSHOT, Phase 4a) was
// added; to 6 when InvItemEntry gained the equipped flag + slot (equipped armour/
// weapon sync); to 7 when the spare pad became `section` (a section-name hash so the
// two weapon slots - both AttachSlot ATTACH_WEAPON, indistinguishable by `slot` - are
// told apart and Weapon I/II placement replicates); to 8 when the world-item channel
// (PKT_WORLD_ITEM snapshot + PKT_WORLD_ITEM_REMOVE, Phase W1) was added - host-
// authoritative, interest-scoped, netId-keyed ground items; to 9 when InvItemEntry gained
// manufacturer + material stringIDs (WEAPONS cannot be reconstructed by the engine factory
// without their manufacturer/mesh GameData - createItem returns null - so a picked-up or
// looted weapon silently failed to appear on the peer; armour/loose items never needed it);
// to 10 when the CONSERVATION drop channel (PKT_WORLD_DROP, Phase W2) was added - a weapon
// can't be fabricated on a peer, so instead of streaming a template the dropper authors a
// reliable DROP intent and each client RELOCATES its own real copy of that weapon to the
// ground (bag -> world). Bidirectional (host or join may drop). Checked during handshake;
// a mismatch is rejected (no back-compat);
// to 11 when the conservation PICKUP channel (PKT_WORLD_PICKUP, Phase W3) was added - the
// mirror of a drop: when a character picks a dropped weapon up, its owner authors a reliable
// PICKUP intent and each peer relocates the REAL ground copy it has been tracking back into
// that character's bag (world -> bag). Because the engine's spatial item query is unreliable
// in towns, each client tracks the actual dropped Item* handle rather than re-finding it;
// to 12 when the wall-clock TIME-SYNC channel (PKT_TIME_PING/PKT_TIME_PONG) was added -
// the join periodically pings with its wall clock, the host echoes with its own, and the
// join estimates the host-relative clock OFFSET (NTP-style, min-RTT filtered), logging
// CLOCKSYNC lines the validation oracles use to time-align host/join logs across two
// machines whose wall clocks disagree (a remote-play prerequisite);
// to 13 when the owner-authoritative MEDICAL channel was added (phase 2 of the
// player-combat/medical plan): PKT_MEDICAL streams an owned PLAYER-SQUAD
// character's local-only medical model (blood, bleed, per-limb flesh+bandaging,
// unc/dead flags) to the peer, change-gated + throttled, so driven copies render
// true vitals instead of diverging forever (spikes 21-23); and PKT_TREATMENT
// carries first aid administered ON a driven copy back to the body's OWNER
// (per-limb bandage levels, raise-only apply) so cross-player healing lands on
// the authoritative body. World NPCs stay on the events-only model;
// to 14 when the CONSENSUS GAME-SPEED channel was added: each client's UI speed
// (pause/1x/2x/3x) is a REQUEST (PKT_SPEED_REQ, join -> host; the host consumes
// its own locally), the host arbitrates effective = min(requests) capped at 1x
// while either player squad is in combat, and broadcasts PKT_SPEED_SET which
// both sides apply. Divergent speeds would diverge every rate-based local
// simulation (medical, hunger, cosmetic fights), so speed is consensus state;
// to 15 when the combat intent split into ACTIVE vs WAITING stances
// (TASK_COMBAT_WAIT): Kenshi's attack-slot system keeps most of a crowd
// "engaged but queued", and driving those copies with the active-attack
// re-issue loop reset their AI every throttle tick (clearGoals) and teleported
// them around. The host now classifies its combatState (sword state) and the
// join leaves waiting copies holding their goal in a menace ring;
// to 16 when the medical channel grew to FULL anatomy + limb loss (full
// medical/limb sync plan): MedicalPacket now carries every body part (head/
// chest/stomach + limbs; humans have 7, MED_PARTS_MAX slots) with flesh AND
// fleshStun AND bandaging AND juryRigging per part (keyed by anatomy index -
// deterministic across clients loading the same save), plus the 4 LimbStates
// (stump/crushed/replaced) and the robotic replacement template stringIDs;
// TreatmentPacket forwards per-PART bandage levels; EVT_AMPUTATE/EVT_CRUSH
// reliable events carry the limb-loss transitions (medical packet states are
// the self-heal). Combat-scoped world NPCs now stream vitals too (host-
// authoritative), so a battered NPC no longer renders pristine on the join;
// to 17 when the owner-authoritative CHARACTER-STATS channel (PKT_STATS) was
// added: CharStats (strength..smithing, xp) is local-only like medical, so a
// character leveled mid-session stayed stale on the peer - and the peer's
// engine RESOLVES real fights with that stale copy (a join character vs a
// world NPC resolves on the HOST). Owned player-squad members only,
// change-gated + throttled; the stream also self-heals the junk XP a driven
// copy's cosmetic fights accumulate locally;
// to 18 when CARRIED-BODY sync was added: picking up / carrying / dropping a
// KO'd player-squad member. The CARRIER's owner authors reliable
// EVT_PICKUP_BODY/EVT_DROP_BODY edges (subject = carried, actor = carrier);
// continuous state self-heals them (synthetic TASK_CARRY_BODY on the carrier
// + a BODY_CARRIED bodyState bit on the carried). Each machine executes the
// SAME pickup between its LOCAL pair via the engine's own pickupObject, so
// the shoulder attach / carry animation / transform-follow are engine-native
// on both sides; a carried copy is exempt from the down-enforcement hold and
// all position driving (the local attach owns its transform);
// to 19 when FURNITURE OCCUPANCY sync was added (beds + prison cages): the
// carry shape applied to a stateful attach. The OCCUPANT's owner authors
// reliable EVT_ENTER_FURNITURE/EVT_EXIT_FURNITURE edges (subject = occupant,
// actor = the furniture's save-stable hand, arg = 1 bed / 2 cage) off
// Character::inSomething transitions; continuous BODY_IN_BED/BODY_IN_CAGE
// bodyState bits self-heal them. Each machine executes the SAME placement
// between its LOCAL pair via the engine's own setBedMode/setPrisonMode, so
// the in-bed/in-cage pose and transform are engine-native on both sides; an
// occupied copy is exempt from down-enforcement and position driving (the
// furniture owns its transform).
// to 20 when STEALTH sync was added: a BODY_SNEAK bodyState bit streams
// Character::stealthMode exactly (BODY_CRAWL stays isStealthModeOrCrawling -
// it includes injured crawl, which must never trigger setStealthMode), and
// the receiver applies the engine's own setStealthMode to its driven copy so
// the sneak-walk is engine-native. PKT_STEALTH streams the DETECTION map
// (whoSeesMeSneaking: per-seer YesNoMaybe + progress) of a driven sneaker
// back to its OWNER - the first owner-directed FEEDBACK channel: the host's
// authoritative world computes who notices the sneaker (spike: detection DOES
// fire against driven copies), and the owner replays each entry between its
// LOCAL pair via notifyICanSeeYouSneaking so the marker arrows render
// natively on the player's own screen.
// to 21 when RUNTIME-SPAWN proxy replication was added: NPC sync resolves
// bodies by save-stable hand, so a squad the host's spawn manager mints at
// RUNTIME (roaming bandits, dialog ambushes) has a host-only hand the join
// can never resolve - the host fought enemies the join couldn't see (spike
// 01, field report 2026-07-07). PULL-based: the join sends PKT_SPAWN_REQ
// (reliable, debounced per hand) for any streamed hand it cannot resolve;
// the host resolves it locally and replies PKT_SPAWN_INFO (character
// template stringID + faction stringID + transform + alive flag); the join
// spawns a local PROXY body from that description and drives it through the
// SAME world-NPC path as a baked NPC (AI-suspend, damage guard, combat
// rendering all inherit - the hand->proxy translation happens at the single
// applyTargets resolve choke point);
// to 22 when the MONEY channel (PKT_MONEY) was added: Kenshi's wallet is
// per-Platoon (Ownerships::money - no global player wallet, spike 29) and
// nothing about it was on the wire (shop_probe run 104watch: sentinel writes
// never crossed), so any purchase/sale/bounty changed cats on ONE client only.
// Owner-authoritative by squad-tab RANK (the same partition positional/
// inventory sync own): each client publishes the wallet of every tab it OWNS,
// change-gated on the reliable channel with a safety resend; the receiver
// writes the peer tab's wallet via Ownerships::setMoney;
// to 23 when RECRUITMENT sync was added: recruiting re-containers the subject
// into a player platoon (a NEW hand the peer can never resolve), so a recruit
// existed on the recruiting client only (recruit_probe run 114151: the peer
// either minted a DUPLICATE proxy next to its still-standing baked copy, or -
// join -> host - saw nothing at all, the describe channel being join-pull
// only). Three changes: a reliable EVT_RECRUIT edge (subject = the OLD hand,
// actor = the NEW hand) lets the peer RE-KEY its existing local body to the
// recruiter's new stream key instead of duplicating; the describe/mint spawn
// channel (PKT_SPAWN_REQ/INFO) runs BIDIRECTIONALLY so a runtime-born recruit
// resolves in either direction; and recruited hands are owned by their
// RECRUITER regardless of which local tab rank they land in (the probe showed
// a join recruit landing in the HOST-owned rank-0 container);
// to 24 when FACTION-RELATION sync was added (PKT_FACTION): relation state is
// per-client `FactionRelations` and nothing crossed (faction_probe run
// 132239: sentinel setRelation writes stuck locally, never moved the peer),
// so attacking a faction flipped hostility on ONE machine only. The probe
// showed faction GameData stringIDs are cross-client stable, the engine keeps
// the two tables MIRRORED (player->them == them->player in every row), and
// the enemy/ally flags DERIVE from the value - so ONE float per faction sid
// is the whole state. SYMMETRIC change detection: both clients sample their
// player-faction table (~1 Hz, immediately on a detoured affectRelations
// mutation), stream rows that moved vs the seeded shared-save baseline
// (change-gated reliable), and apply received rows onto both local table
// directions - updating the baseline BEFORE the write keeps it echo-free;
// to 25 when GAME-CLOCK sync was added (PKT_TIME): each client integrates its
// own in-game clock from its own load/pause moments, so day/night (NPC
// schedules, shop hours, stealth vision) diverges. time_probe (run 141509)
// showed the clock is ABSOLUTE campaign time (save-derived; the host-join
// offset was exactly the load-moment skew), hour length is identical on both
// clients, and the clock rate tracks frameSpeedMult exactly (2x burst -> 2.00
// rate ratio) - so the correction lever is a SLEW, not a memory write: the
// host broadcasts its clock ~1 Hz and the join scales its local sim speed
// quietly (on top of the arbitrated consensus speed) until the offset closes;
// to 26 when DOOR-STATE sync was added (PKT_DOOR): door/gate open+lock state
// on BAKED buildings is per-client (door_probe run 160041: sentinel toggles
// through the engine's own openDoor/closeDoor stuck locally, never moved the
// peer), so one player walks through a gate the other sees closed. The probe
// showed baked-door hands are cross-client stable (census intersection on
// the shared save) and the polite write lever works (state animates
// OPENING->OPEN; `open` on the wire is the collapsed DESTINATION state).
// SYMMETRIC change detection, the faction shape: both clients sample nearby
// doors ~1 Hz, stream rows whose (open, locked) moved vs a seeded per-hand
// baseline, and apply received rows via the same engine actions - updating
// the baseline BEFORE the write keeps it echo-free; per-sender seq drops
// stale rows; rows for hands that fail to resolve locally are skipped
// (out-of-interest or runtime door - accepted edge);
// to 27 when PLACED-BUILDING sync was added (PKT_BUILD_PLACE +
// PKT_BUILD_STATE): a player-placed building is a RUNTIME object - its hand
// exists only in the placer's session (build_probe run 174550: census hand
// intersection was ZERO for minted sites; the protocol-21 identity problem
// for structures), so a building one player places does not exist at all for
// the other, and construction progress has no channel. PLACER-AUTHORITATIVE
// describe/mint: a local placement (UI commit detour on placeFinalPreview-
// Building, or a programmatic scenario place) announces template sid +
// transform keyed by the PLACER's local hand; the receiver mints a local
// construction site via the same createBuilding factory (probe-proven to
// bypass the UI's town-placement rules) and keeps a key -> local-hand
// translation map. Progress then streams as change-gated PKT_BUILD_STATE
// rows (~1 Hz sample, 10 s safety resend while incomplete) applied through
// the engine's own setConstructionProgress (probe: 0..1 scale, engine
// self-completes at >= 1.0 natively). The receiver's mint never re-announces
// (it does not pass through the placement detour) - echo-free by
// construction;
// to 28 when PLACED-BUILDING DOOR + DISMANTLE sync was added
// (PKT_BUILD_DOOR + PKT_BUILD_REMOVE): a placed building's doors are
// runtime objects too, so the protocol-26 door channel skips them (bdoor_probe
// run 195513: toggles stayed local), and a dismantled/destroyed placed
// building left a GHOST proxy on the peer (11 census samples after the
// placer's destroy). The probe proved the translation identity: a minted
// proxy mints its own DoorStuff children in the same template order
// (parent->doors index 0 on both sides), so a placed door's wire key is
// (PLACER's building hand, door index) resolved through the protocol-27
// build maps on both ends - the raw door hand never crosses. Door rows are
// the symmetric protocol-26 shape on the translated key; removal is
// placer-authoritative (dismantle detour edge or programmatic destroy ->
// PKT_BUILD_REMOVE -> the peer destroys its mapped proxy via the engine's
// own GameWorld::destroy and tombstones the map entry);
// to 29 when HUNGER sync was added (MedicalPacket grew hunger + fed):
// hunger is a per-client local simulation - each engine decays EVERY
// character's hunger and eating happens only on the owner's client, so a
// driven copy starves in the peer's view (hunger_probe run 213751: the
// engine's scale is ~0..3, the ACTIVE leader decayed ~0.024/s while its
// idle driven copy decayed ~0.0002/s - a 40% owner-vs-copy gap opened in
// one 50 s run; sentinel writes stick and stay local). The owner's
// hunger/fed ride the existing owner-authoritative medical snapshot
// (change-gated by the quantized fingerprint; -1 = field not carried, the
// KENSHICOOP_HUNGER_SYNC A/B hatch);
// to 30 when COORDINATED SAVE + SESSION RESUME was added (protocol 31):
// the HOST's save is authoritative - on a coordinated save (any local save
// edge on the host, or a join save request forwarded as PKT_SAVE_REQ with
// the join's local write suppressed) the host writes its native save, waits
// for the save folder to QUIESCE (the save is deferred + multi-file), then
// streams the whole folder to the join over CH_RELIABLE in ~4 KB chunks
// (PKT_SAVE_BEGIN / PKT_SAVE_FILE / PKT_SAVE_DONE with per-file FNV CRCs);
// the join stages into save/<name>__incoming/, verifies, commits atomically
// over save/<name>/ and PKT_SAVE_ACKs. Resume = both clients load the
// identical file, re-running the shared-save-lineage guarantee all the
// hand-keyed replication rests on (no sidecar; session-placed buildings and
// recruits bake into ONE save with ONE hand, identical on both sides);
// to 31 when COORDINATED LOAD was added (protocol 32): the HOST is
// load-authoritative, mirroring the save arbitration. A host load edge
// broadcasts PKT_LOAD_GO (name + folder fingerprint + loadId); the join
// fingerprint-verifies its on-disk copy and loads the identical save, or
// answers PKT_LOAD_NACK (missing/diverged copy) so the host streams the
// folder via the existing protocol-31 SaveXfer after its own reload, the
// join loading after commit. A load initiated on the JOIN is suppressed
// locally and forwarded as PKT_LOAD_REQ (the host arbitrates). Both sides
// run a full session reset on their own world-reload edge; loadId guards
// stale GO/NACK pairs across the swap;
// to 32 when PRODUCTION MACHINE sync was added (protocol 33): machines
// (production / crafting / furnace / farm / research) simulate per-client -
// prod_probe run 152730 measured the owner's bench output moving under
// operate() while the peer's copy stayed flat, and a power toggle never
// crossing. The HOST is the machine authority (world-simulation precedent):
// it samples machine-class buildings in the interest spheres ~1 Hz and
// streams change-gated PKT_PROD rows (power bit, production state, output
// buffer item+amount, input amounts, farm growth floats; -1 = field not
// carried); the join applies through the probe-validated engine levers
// (switchPowerOn / setProductionItem - which also MATERIALIZES a null
// output buffer - / direct ConsumptionItem::amount + farm-float writes).
// BAKED machines key by their save-stable hand; session-placed ones by the
// protocol-27 placer key (keyKind disambiguates), translated through the
// build maps on both ends.
//
// v33 (protocol 34): InvSnapshotHeader gains a keyKind byte - the PKT_PROD
// identity approach applied to the container-inventory channel, so the host's
// container census can author SESSION-PLACED chests/machines under their
// protocol-27 placer key (0 = raw hand, the previous implicit behaviour).
//
// v34 (protocol 35): EVT_SQUAD_MOVE on the existing EventPacket - a squad-tab
// move re-containers the body (squad_probe: container AND index/serial all
// change, every move mints a fresh hand), so the mover streams the re-key
// edge exactly like EVT_RECRUIT. No struct change; the version gates the
// event id.
//
// v35 (protocol 36): sendMs on EntityBatchHeader (+ PKT_NPC_CENSUS). Interp
// buffers were indexed by ARRIVAL time, so real-path jitter (Steam relay)
// smeared straight into the snapshot spacing - the walk-drive consumed
// bursts and starved (the jumpy remote-player movement of the 2026-07-09
// session). The sender's millisecond stamp restores the true 20 Hz spacing;
// the receiver maps it into its own clock with a min-offset tracker.
// ENTITY_BATCH_MAX drops 18 -> 17 to keep a full batch inside the datagram
// budget with the wider header.
//
// v36 (protocol 37): CROSS-OWNER TRANSFER intents (PKT_INV_XFER). Inventory
// sync is single-writer per container (Doctrine 8), but the UI lets a player
// drag items straight between squads - a direct mutation of a PEER-authored
// container the owner never sees. The owner's next snapshot then reconciled
// the drag AWAY: an item dragged OUT was re-fabricated on the dragger (a
// dupe, since the dragger's own container also kept the moved item) while
// the owner never lost its copy; an item dragged IN was destroyed by the
// same reconcile; and a dragged WEAPON - which createItem cannot rebuild -
// vanished on the dragger's screen while the owner-side surplus was
// destroyed via removeItemAutoDestroy (trade_probe run 133142 baselined all
// three signatures). The fix is the conservation model applied to bags: the
// dragging client detects the completed cross-owner move by diffing each
// tracked container against its last-known baseline, PAIRS the loss with
// the matching gain, and authors ONE reliable transfer intent (src + dst
// container hands + item identity + qty). The receiver relocates the REAL
// Item* between its own copies of those containers (removeItemDontDestroy +
// tryAddItem - never fabricates or destroys, so weapons survive), while the
// sender latches the pending transfer so the owner's stale snapshots cannot
// reconcile it back in the interim. Gear transfers also suppress the W2
// weapon-census drop/pickup interpretation for that sid on both ends (a
// bag-to-bag trade is not a ground drop).
//
// v37 (protocol 38): RESEARCH TECH-TREE sync (PKT_RESEARCH). The unlock store
// (PlayerInterface::technology, a per-client Research object) never crossed:
// a tech the host researched stayed un-known on the join forever (spike 401 -
// host isKnown(subject) 0->1 after startResearch while the join read 0 for
// the whole run). Host-authoritative snapshot rows (the world-simulation
// precedent): the host samples its known set ~1 Hz through the engine's own
// Research::isKnown over the shared RESEARCH GameData enumeration and streams
// one reliable row per known stringID (first sight sends the whole set as the
// baseline, then a lost-row safety resend); the join applies each row through
// Research::startResearch - the exact lever a research-UI click commits, which
// flips isKnown in the same tick and is idempotent against already-known sids.
// The engine levers are located at runtime by unique prologue scan (the
// running image is base-skewed from the on-disk exe, spike 401).
//
// v38 (pack-hidden investigation, 2026-07-11): NPC census rows carry the
// host's POSITION alongside each hand (5xu32 -> 5xu32 + 3xf32 per NPC). The
// existence census answered only "does this NPC exist"; two locally-simulated
// copies of the SAME census-present NPC could wander arbitrarily far apart at
// render range (the join's copy visible somewhere the host's copy isn't).
// With positions on the wire the join can PARK a census-present local copy
// that diverged past a threshold back onto the host's authoritative spot.
//
// v39 (creature-size sync, 2026-07-12): SpawnInfoPacket carries the host
// body's AGE. Animals scale body size by age; minting proxies with a fixed
// adult age made every join-side creature full-grown regardless of the
// host's actual (often juvenile) animal.
//
// v40 (ground-weapon identity, 2026-07-13): WorldPickupPacket carries the
// originating DROP's shared identity (refDropOwnerId, refDropId). Ground
// weapons were tracked FIFO-by-stringID, so picking up one of two same-sid
// weapons on the ground (one dropped by each client) re-homed the peer's
// front-of-queue copy - the WRONG instance. The picker now correlates the
// exact Item* that re-entered its bag to the drop it tracked and names that
// instance; the peer re-homes precisely that (owner,id)-keyed copy.
//
// v41 (chained/pole prisoner sync, 2026-07-16): a NEW bodyState bit
// BODY_CHAINED (Character::isChained) rides the furniture-occupancy pipeline
// as kind=3. Kenshi puts a captive on a prisoner POLE via the chained/slave
// mechanism (isChained + slaveOwner + setChainedMode/slaveAttachToBoneMode),
// which is a DIFFERENT engine system from a cage (inSomething==IN_PRISON /
// setPrisonMode). Cages were the only prison state synced, so a unit shackled
// to a pole never crossed the wire - the join left it at the last carried/KO
// stage. The furniture reliable enter/exit edges reuse the SAME shape for
// chain: arg=3, and the actor hand carries the OWNER (setChainedMode needs an
// owner, and the pole position rides the continuous transform).
// Protocol 42 (shackle lock-state sync): InvItemEntry gains a `locked` bit
// (equipped LockedArmour with a live lock). Cage occupancy (IN_PRISON) masks the
// chained furniture kind on the drive side, so a caged prisoner's shackle
// unlock never crossed; the locked bit is an occupancy-independent lock signal
// (feeds the content hash so a lock toggle triggers a resend), paired with a
// non-owner unlock guard that re-asserts the owner-authoritative chained state.
//
// Protocol 43 (camera-anchored interest, PKT_CAM_HINT): the join sends its
// CAMERA world center to the host at ~1 Hz (unreliable, latest wins). Interest
// anchors were squad-tab leaders only, so NPCs where a player is LOOKING (but
// its PC is not standing) fell outside the stream bubble - the manual camp
// finding of host-visible units missing on the join near the streamed edge.
// The host folds a fresh hint into interestCenters (up to 4 anchors: 2 tab
// leaders + own camera + peer camera); the host camera never crosses the wire
// (read locally).
//
// Protocol 44 (bounty/crime sync, PKT_BOUNTY): a character's wanted level
// (Character::crimes, an inline BountyManager at Character+0xF0) is per-client
// local state and nothing crossed the wire (spikes 59/60). The 2026-07-20 live
// run settled the authority as H2 witness-local: the durable bounty row
// materialises SOLELY on the HOST's driven copy of a JOIN-owned character
// (the host runs the witness/guard->assignBountyForCrimes pipeline, the owner
// stays had=0 rows=0/0) - the OPPOSITE of the owner-authoritative faction
// channel (protocol 24). So the channel is HOST-AUTHORITATIVE, keyed
// per-(owner-character hand, faction sid) since BountyManager is inline
// per-Character: the host samples every character whose local BountyManager
// holds a row (its driven copies of remote PCs + host-owned PCs), diffs each
// row's {amount, crimes, claimed} against a silently-seeded shared-save
// baseline, and streams change-gated PKT_BOUNTY rows DOWN to the clients; the
// owning client applies the row onto its own (clean) copy via the engine's own
// levers (unfairAddToBounty for a raise, clearBounty for a drop to zero). The
// join NEVER publishes its bounty state upstream (unidirectional host->clients,
// no echo path), which is why the receiver applies with an echo-guarded
// baseline and the publish gate is host-only. seq is per-sender monotonic
// (stale-row guard, as PKT_FACTION).

//     rtt    = t1 - t0
//     offset = th + rtt/2 - t1      (host wall clock minus join wall clock)
// keeping the minimum-RTT sample (least queueing noise). The join logs
// "CLOCKSYNC offset=<ms> rtt=<ms> n=<samples>" lines which Get-ScenarioSeries
