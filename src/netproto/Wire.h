// 46 (2026-07-31, upstream merge): this is ALSO the deliberate guard against the
// two protocol collisions this merge exposed between the fork and nhoral/main,
// both of which lived under the SAME version 45:
//   * tag 42 was PKT_BOUNTY here and PKT_COMBAT_HIT upstream (fixed by moving
//     PKT_BOUNTY to 43 - see the enum below);
//   * PKT_MONEY (tag 21, 13 bytes on both sides) means a DELTA against the
//     shared faction wallet here and an ABSOLUTE per-tab value upstream. Same
//     tag, same size, opposite semantics - nothing in the framing can catch it.
// The handshake compares PROTOCOL_VERSION for exact equality and nothing else
// (no build hash, no capability negotiation - NetLink.cpp ~513/~571,
// SteamInvite.cpp ~285). Bumping to 46 therefore turns "connects and silently
// corrupts money/health" into a clean, immediate version-mismatch rejection
// against any build that is not exactly this one. Do not lower it back to 45

// keeping the minimum-RTT sample (least queueing noise). The join logs
// "CLOCKSYNC offset=<ms> rtt=<ms> n=<samples>" lines which Get-ScenarioSeries
